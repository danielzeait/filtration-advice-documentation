                    The user must use test reports that used the same test
                    standard to compare filters. Not doing so, renders
                    comparison results not valid.

                    The filters being evaluated operate in either constant air
                    volume (CAV) or variable air volume (VAV) systems that use
                    a fan that complies with the energy conservation practices
                    established by standards such as AMCA 205, IECC, ISO 12759
                    and ASHRAE 90.1, and that the complete system complies with
                    all applicable design, construction, and operating
                    standards as well as with the best engineering practices.

                    m. 
                    The differential pressure of the filters is measured
                    directly on the filters and does not require any
                    consideration or correction of readings due to a pressure
                    drop produced by any duct length or device installed
                    between pressure taps.

                    n. 
                    The initial pressure drop of a clean filter can vary due to
                    manufacturing tolerances and/or variance of physical
                    properties of the filter media. The pressure drops of the
                    test report are corrected to reflect the initial pressure
                    drop of the clean filters measured on site.

                    o. 
                    The optimal filter changeout time prediction is based on a
                    probabilistic model that includes elements of randomness.
